The most important currency in the world of social media is attention. The better the recommended content is, the more time people spend on the platform. People spend hours scrolling on social media daily. That's why these applications need to develop an efficient recommendation system. In this paper I'll describe recommendation system algorithms, image classification algorithms and how a recommendation system works in general. In the end we will look at some real life implementations from technology giants such as Instagram or Twitter.
