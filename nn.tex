\section{Two Tower Neural Networks} \label{nn}

Above the input layer is the embedding layer; it is a fully
connected layer that projects the sparse representation to
a dense vector.  \cite{10.1145/3038912.3052569}

\section{Convolutional Neural Networks}

Unfortunately, most large corporations are closed-source, keeping competition on the internet. With a few exceptions, with the the recent change of X (Twitter) going open-source. \ref{cnn/xalgorithm} The next following subsections will explain some of the popular open-source image recognition neural networks.
